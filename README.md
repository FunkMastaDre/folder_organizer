# The Folder Organizer
#### Description: Organizes all files in the folder the program is placed in. They will be organized based off the file extension. (Example: All image files and text files will be in their respective folder. Perfect for your downloads folder!)

I, along with others I know, have a downloads folder with files months, or even years' worth of files. These folders could use a way to be organized without having to do it manually, so I figured an organizer program would be a good idea! This was my first real programming project outside of game.

Instructions: Place this folder(not just the organizer.py file) into whichever folder you'd like to organize. Then run organizer.py and watch as all of your files are neatly organized into folders! A "log.txt" file will be created afterward for you to look back at what files were moved to which folder.
